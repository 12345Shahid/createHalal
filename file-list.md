below is the comprehensive description of the project. any people I mean any developer or AI can read this and can understand what I want to build.


Okay you need to design the homepage. I won't give you much directions about that just  make a standard  home page and do the best practices and it should be enough to compete with the other websites from similar companies in the market.  This is the link of the image for the hero section https://ibb.co.com/9HCSyy4. And yes you can also add any suitable content as you wish and try to add all the halal content or don't add anything. It will be easier for me if you can add content. the topic of my website  is an AI tool like copy.ai or gravity write. The color palette of the website should be same as the color palette of Diprella so combine the white and the other color (maybe that color )was green. I mean combine those two colors like them. And yes keep the same color palette across the whole website for consistency.
Name of my website is createHalal

Okay this is the menu design( which means you need to edit the navigation menu.tsx file) I wanted now don't try to change the design Don't even touch it. As you can see in this example there are only a few tools under each category but there are a lot of tools under each category in case I am going to give you the list of all the tools under each category and you are going to write the full code in case the comments will help you to place the other tools I mean you it will help you to identify the location where you need to place the other tools. And the design should be as it is. And yes I wanted the menu in the top right corner of the header and I guess this code ensures that. in case if you need to do something to ensure the position of the menu in the homepage then you can do that but if you think that this code is okay then keep it as it is. This code should ensure that The menu is at the right position. In case the header contains the text createHalal and some other options like sign up, login ,contact. I hope you understand what am I talking about. Now list of all the tools for each category is written below:

Styling Adjustments (Optional):

If needed, adjust the CSS styles to align the menu more precisely with your header design.

You can modify the navigationMenuTriggerStyle() function or the classes used in the NavigationMenu component. Only do any kind of modification in the design for matching the color palette or don't do anything. in short if I say finally then this is the decision.


For each tool, create a new page under the /tools/ directory with a matching route.

Example: For "Quick Blog Generator", create anew page under the /tools/ directory with a matching route.

Example: For "Quick Blog Generator", create a file at /tools/quick-blog-generator.tsx and design the tool interface there.
Now I don't want to give you much directions about the tool interface design but make standard designs and do the best practices for competing with other similar tools available in the market. But you should obviously maintain two things firstly the input fields  will vary. For example for the quick blog generator tool there will be input fields like negative box ( where the user will describe what he don't want to include in the generated content ) ,word range (like 1500 to 2500), ( tone like excited,  professional ). in case for the other tools under the category they won't have the same input fields even the output feels may also vary. And the tools in different category they will also have different input fields.  as I want maximum user satisfaction so add all the
possible input fields so that the users can customize the content as the wishes and you can also make output fields as you wish. but yes as all the tools will give the output in the text format so there should be enough options for manual editing in all the tool interfaces and you can keep it same for all the two interfaces and the second thing is that keep some design similarities in all the tool interfaces as they are in the same website. In case people should be able to access the tool interface after logging in. And yes there is some matter of something else. I guess it is called URL routing. Like the menu should be visible to everyone even if they are not signed up. It will include all the pages of the website but the blogs and the pricings and the contact Will be visible to everyone. in case people will be able to see the tools option also. I mean this menu will also include the tools option. In case I gave you the code and the code contains the design for that. When a visitor will click on a tool category(Blog Tools ) then he will see all the specific tools under that category. for example if someone clicks on the blog tools category then you will see all the specific tools (like quick lock generator ) under blog tools category but if he clicks on any specific tool then he will be automatically redirected to the login page. in case he will login or sign up ( in the login page there will be an option to register also. visitor will be able to register if he don't have an account ) and then he will be redirected to that tool interface where he wanted to go and he will start using that specific tool but if someone clicks on blogs or pricing page or contact page then he will be able to see everything( without logging in) in the page ( without logging in). so the blogs and the pricings and the contact page is completely public and the tools option(  tool categories and specific tool names under those categories is also public)  but if someone wants to use any specific tool then he will need to login or sign up. Now for matching with the requirements you can change the codes but don't change the style or the animation or the components which are given for beauty.


Dashboard 

You can see there's a picture of an example of dashboard. In the example it has 4 sections.  the first section is Reviews. , the second section is Avg. Rating and the third section is investment analysis. And below these three sections there is another section called Total Visitors. But I don't want these. in my case the first section should be for showing the total credits my user has for generating content from the website. The second section should reveal or should show how many credits he got by referring the website to other peoples and the third section should show how many credits he got by watching ads ( actually the first one is the summation of these two I mean the summation of second and third section). In case I don't have any integration functionality with any ad system with my website ( at present ) so in that section,  keep it like ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù. Finally the section below these three sections which is now called the total visitors It should be changed and it should be showing the recent activity ( activities of last 2 month. I mean a list of the content he generated in last 2 month using different tools from the website. ) of the user . It is like a history. And you can see in the image that the menu is at the left side but don't keep it there because in my website the menu should be always in the right side. Keep the color palette same as the homepage in case the color palette should be same across the whole website and the standard color palette is the color palette of homepage in this project.  Okay now the 4th section( which is below the 1st 3 sections and should represent the history and some other functionalities). as I want it to be replaced so the design to replace it 




[ The homepage will be always the same. But after logging in The user should see the option to choose dark mode or light mode . In case after logging in I guess he will be in the dashboard so it will be very good if the option is in the dashboard. After he switches to the dark mode it will be dark theme for the whole website and light mode will be light for the whole site. In case the picture I gave to replace the fourth section which is below three sections is a standard. The difference is that in that picture the color combination is drak and blue but the color combination should be same as Diprella. ( You can take the color palette from the Diprella website as a sample ) ]



Help center 
In this image you can see that( image of help center page ) there are categories of documentations on the website and there is a search bar for searching documentations across the categories. So just keep the design as it is but change the color palette for consistency and our standard color palette is the color palette of homepage. So you must use that in all the pages. add appropriate categories and documents as you are creating the website so you know what to write.



Pricings 
Yet we don't follow traditional pricing system. In our case you will share our website and get credits. You can use those credits to generate content. the process is explained below with a real life example. 


 suppose there are two users user1 and user2. Now the user1 shared our website using his unique link to the user2. In case user1 will get the link at  his dashboard and it will be unique for every user. Now user1 will automatically get one credit because one user signed up or I should say registered using his link. Now if user2 earns any credit by sharing our website or by watching ads then the user1 will get the same amount of credit automatically. For example suppose user2 shared our website to five people and got five credits then user1 will get five credits automatically without doing anything because the user2 came from the reference of the user1 or I should say the referral link of user1. One credit is enough for generating one content from any of the tool or I should say it is for one token. Using one credit user can have one blog or one video or one audio. in simple terms he can have one output from any tool ( under any category) as the user wish. 

As it is very simple to share our website using your unique link so you can get unlimited credits and generate unlimited content daily. 

Our final goal is to create a community of Halal content creators, to help you for getting some Halal information and to help you build something Halal. So keep supporting us by sharing our website as much as you can.


Blogs 

In this image you can see the Blogs page of the website .So just keep the design as it is but change the color palette for consistency and our standard color palette is the color palette of homepage. So you must use that in all the pages. The design have many blogs in different categories. We have two categories Islamic, Halal Tips.create the page, and include the blogs in  the categories appropriately I gave you the category name as well as contents below.



1. Islamic Category: "Results of Sabr"
Image link https://ibb.co.com/cb2CtcH



The Virtues and Outcomes of Sabr (Patience)

In Islam, Sabr‚Äîpatience‚Äîis a virtue of immense significance. It represents endurance, perseverance, and steadfastness in the face of life's trials. The Qur'an and Hadiths emphasize the importance of Sabr, promising rewards for those who practice it.


The Qur'an states: "Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account." (Qur'an 39:10) This verse highlights the boundless rewards awaiting those who exercise patience.

Practicing Sabr leads to personal growth and spiritual elevation. It enables individuals to navigate challenges with resilience, maintaining faith in Allah's wisdom. Through patience, one develops inner strength, emotional intelligence, and a deeper connection with the Creator.

Moreover, Sabr cultivates empathy and compassion. By enduring hardships, individuals become more understanding and supportive of others facing difficulties. This fosters a sense of community and mutual assistance, core principles in Islam.


In essence, the results of Sabr are multifaceted: spiritual rewards, personal development, and societal harmony. Embracing patience transforms challenges into opportunities for growth, aligning believers with the divine path ordained by Allah.

2. Halal Tips Category: "How to Write a Halal Blog"

Image link https://ibb.co.com/PtJNxvz



Guidelines for Crafting a Halal-Compliant Blog

Creating a blog that adheres to Islamic principles involves mindful content creation and ethical considerations. Here are key steps to ensure your blog aligns with Halal standards:

1. Content Integrity: Ensure all information shared is truthful and beneficial. Avoid spreading falsehoods or engaging in gossip.


2. Respectful Language: Use language that is respectful and free from profanity. Uphold the dignity of all individuals and communities.

3.  Avoiding Harmful Content: Refrain from sharing content that promotes violence, indecency, or any form of harm.


4. Citing Sources: Attribute information to credible sources. This practice reflects honesty and builds trust with your audience.


5. Ethical Monetization: If monetizing your blog, ensure that advertisements and partnerships comply with Halal standards, avoiding products or services that are Haram.


6. Inclusivity and Respect: Foster an inclusive environment by respecting diverse perspectives and cultures, in line with Islamic teachings of tolerance.



By following these guidelines, you can create a blog that is not only engaging but also aligns with Islamic ethical standards, contributing positively to the online community.

Profile 

In this image you can see the profile page of the website .So just keep the design  and attributes or  fields (like name, email) as it is but change the color palette for consistency and our standard color palette is the color palette of homepage. So you must use that in all the pages. And there is no menu in the image but add the menu in all the pages including this. In case find someone will register or I should say sign up then some of the fields will be automatically filled up because he gave those information in the sign up page but the other informations will be optional and he can complete the profile by coming here or I should say by coming to this page.



Change Language

I don't have any image for this section but Make a standard change language option in the website and it should be in the middle when people will click on that from the menu then they will see all the language options and they will select their preferred language for interacting with the website.

About Us 

In this image you can see the About us page of the website .So just keep the design as it is but change the color palette for consistency and our standard color palette is the color palette of homepage. So you must use that in all the pages. And there is no menu in the image but add the menu in all the pages including this. In case you don't need to create any demo content You can replace the image in this design with the image of the hero section and you can replace the text in this design with the text I gave you as the brief description of my website


Contact 

Design a standard contact page and do the best practices for competing with the other companies in the market. But yes this should be the contact form ( try to check that if this Google form is working or not before placing it inside the contact page) 


<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAc9FXhsVKwbIQlxIxRXCbXlObfpQgvWELHRV9wWVokmbNIg/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="721" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading‚Ä¶</iframe>


Notifications 

Build a standard notification page and do the best practices. In case the color palette of the page should be matched with the color palette of the whole website for consistency. And yes use firebase cloud messaging for that. Here is the SDKs code



 // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional

Authentication 
Build a standard authentication page and do the best practices. In case the color palette of the page should be matched with the color palette of the whole website for consistency. In case use firebase authentication service and yes I am using the free version of firebase. 

Also enable cookie settings. And also add some terms and conditions and privacy policy page. People will agree with them while signing up. Write the content inside the towns and conditions and privacy policy page which should obviously aligns with my website. In case I want to give you much directions about that just create standard pages and do the best practices.

Chatbot interface 

There is a sample of chatbot interface in the images that I gave you but I don't mean that it should be just like this. well you can change the design if you think is right but I just gave you a sample and you can design the interface like this. But you can modify it as needed. And the chatbot  interface will be same for all the tools no matter what it generates. Now if you find anything in the image which is not in my website description then you can just remove that or if you think that you can add this inside the project then you can do that but do it perfectly if you do that. I mean if you add something ( some new feature) then you should add it perfectly.
But there are only two things for you to maintain . firstly the input fields will vary. for example for the quick blog generator tool there will be input fields like negative box where ( the user will describe what he don't want to include in the generated content) , word range (like 1500 to 2500) , tone (like excited , professional).  in case for the other tools under this category won't have the same input fields even the output fields may also vary. as I want maximum user satisfaction so add all the possible input fields so that the users can customize the content as the wishes and you can also make output fields as you wish but yes as all the tools will give the output in the text format so there should be enough option for manual editing in all the tool interfaces for editing or customizing after generation of the content and you can keep it same for all the tool interfaces and the second thing is that keep some design similarities in all the two interfaces as they are in the same website.

Okay so these are the front end functionalities or pages now let's take a look at the back and functionalities 


1. In the description of the dashboard I told something like there will be three sections in the upper side and one section will represent that how many credits or points the user got by sharing the website. Now try to understand suppose there are two users user1 and user2. Now the user1 shared our website using his unique link to the user2. In case user1 will get the link at somewhere in his dashboard and it will be unique for every user. Now user1 will automatically get one credit because one user signed up or I should say registered using his link. Now if user2 earns any credit by sharing our website or by watching ads then the user1 will get the same amount of credit automatically. For example suppose user2 shared our website to five people and got five credits then user1 will get five credits automatically without doing anything because the user2 came from the reference of the user1 or I should say the referral link of user1. One credit is enough for generating one content from any of the tool or I should say it is for one token. Using one credit user can have one blog or one video or one audio. in simple terms he can have one output from any too( under any category) as the user wish. So I need a mechanism for that and tell me if you need any external API or anything external for this. But it will be better if you can build it by writing code by yourself.


2. API example for all the text based categories ( like blog tool , research tools SEO tools. Facebook and other social media tools which are text-based or I should say which give text as the output) This is an API for the quick blog generator tool from the blog tools category. Now you should build APIs for all the other tools which are under all the other text based categories. In case you can see in this example there is filtering for the input and output to make sure that the content generated by this tool is halal by the rules of Islam. In the same way you should maintain this filtering process at all the APIs for all the text-based tools. And you can also see there is a format in the output because the output gives both text for the blog and image prompt which is also text but it is for generating images. And it provides this in a format. So when you build any tool You should try to keep the output as formatted as possible according to the tool because the format for all the tools are not same. But I don't mean to do something complex if you think that simple output format is right then you can also do that. 


Also if you find any error or bug even in my API example then fix that and you can also edit this if you think is right but don't do something unnecessary. Every API should be specialized for each tool. For example this API is for only generating blogs or I should say this is built only for the quick blog generator. In  case, the API for the hashtag generator tool should only generate halal hashtags nothing else. And every tool will have separated API and every tool must have at least one API . if you can't cover every tool with only one API then any tool can have several APIs if needed but don't add anything unnecessary and every tool should have at least one API. And if you want to combine several tools with one API or I should say if you want to do any exception in this case than tell me for confirmation. And yes I forgot to mention one more thing In this API example code you can see that there are some input fields like tone, word_range, negative_box. in case add all the possible parameters in every API. In case parameters won't be same for all the tools even each tool needs different input fields so it needs different parameters. For user satisfaction you should add all the possible input fields at the front end and to coordinate with the front end you should also add all the needed parameters at the back end. And yes if user don't give input for any parameter even if he don't give input for all the parameters then AI will write as it thinks is right or I should say it will use its default functionality for  each parameter( which is not filled by the user)  and yes there should be no required parameter because all the parameters should be optional. In this API example it has the needed parameters and the parameters are optional. Well keep these principles for all the APIs continuously.
if you want to do any exception in this case than tell me for confirmation. And there is another thing you can see that in the API example the output has a limitation of 7000 words so if you need to add any more limitations in any other tool then you can do that but make sure that The tool has the ability to generate the content with the limit. For example In case if you understand that this G4F model can't generate 7000 words at once then do some customizations and use the same model but it should give a blog of maximum 7000 words. If it can't generate so much content at once then you can make necessary changes to split the process and it will provide the full blog in several steps. So if It is not capable to do that then it should not fail I mean it should not generate content less than 7000 words. rather it can split the generation process and can generate the content in several steps. But it should be The inner functionality of the tool and the user should get the final output at once. If you think you can't make a mechanism like that and the G4F model can't generate 7000 words at once then you should reduce the  limit 7000 as needed.



Here's a simplified and streamlined example of a backend API for your Halal Blog Writer Tool, suitable for handing over to AI as an example. It incorporates basic keyword-based filtering to ensure compliance without relying on external APIs.

Backend API for Halal Blog Writer Tool

Code:


from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from g4f.client import Client

app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize the G4F Client
client = Client()

@app.route('/api/full_blog_writer', methods=['POST'])
def full_blog_writer():
    # Extract the input data
    data = request.json or {}
    prompt = data.get('prompt', '').strip()
    negative_box = data.get('negative_box', '').strip()  # Content to avoid
    word_range = data.get('word_range', '1500-2500')  # Default word range
    tone = data.get('tone', 'neutral')  # Default tone is neutral

    # Input validation for Halal compliance
    if not is_halal(prompt) or not is_halal(negative_box):
        return jsonify({"error": "Input contains prohibited content. Please revise your prompt."}), 400

    try:
        # Generate the full prompt for the model
        full_prompt = f"""
        Write a halal-friendly blog on: {prompt or 'a topic of your choice'}.
        Avoid mentioning: {negative_box or 'nothing specific'}.
        Tone: {tone}.
        Word count range: {word_range}.
        """

        # Call the G4F model
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": full_prompt}]
        )
        blog_content = response.choices[0].message.content

        # Restrict output to a maximum of 7,000 words
        if len(blog_content.split()) > 7000:
            return jsonify({"error": "Generated content exceeds the 7,000-word limit."}), 400

        # Generate prompts for images
        image_prompts = extract_image_prompts(blog_content)

        return jsonify({
            "blog": blog_content,
            "image_prompts": image_prompts
        }), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500


def is_halal(text):
    """
    Simple keyword-based Halal filter for input and output validation.
    """
    prohibited_words = ["haram", "violence", "inappropriate", "forbidden"]
    return not any(word in text.lower() for word in prohibited_words)

def extract_image_prompts(blog_text):
    """
    Generate image prompts from blog sections. For simplicity, extract 
    one prompt per paragraph or based on specific logic.
    """
    paragraphs = blog_text.split("\n")
    image_prompts = []

    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        if len(paragraph.strip()) > 10:  # Avoid empty lines
            image_prompts.append(f"Generate an image for: {paragraph[:50]}...")

    return image_prompts

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True) 


How It Works

1. Endpoint:

POST /api/full_blog_writer

Input: JSON payload with a prompt field, e.g., {"prompt": "The importance of kindness in Islam"}.

Output: The generated blog text and image prompts.



2. Input Validation:

The is_halal function checks the prompt for prohibited words (e.g., "haram", "violence").

If the prompt is invalid, an error message is returned.

3. Output Validation:

After generating the blog, the same is_halal function scans the output to ensure compliance.

If the output is not halal, an error is returned.



4. Image Prompts:

The extract_image_prompts function analyzes the generated blog text and creates prompts for associated images.

Prompts are extracted from key sections of the blog.



5. Final JSON Response:

Includes:

Full blog content (blog field).

A list of image prompts (image_prompts field).

Output Format

The response format ensures consistency with your requirements:

{
    "blog": "This is the full blog text...",
    "image_prompts": [
        "Generate an image for: The introduction of the topic...",
        "Generate an image for: The main section discussing details...",
        "Generate an image for: The concluding thoughts..."
    ]
}

Why This Is Simplified for AI

No External API Key: The example uses only keyword-based filtering, which can be handled by simple logic in Python.

Scalable: Easy to replicate across other text-based tools.

Customizable: You can modify is_halal and extract_image_prompts to suit specific needs.

Additional Context for Halal Filtering

To ensure halal compliance:

1. Simplest Approach:

Use keyword-based filtering as shown in is_halal.

Maintain a configurable list of prohibited words or phrases.

3. History. You may see in the dashboard and also in the chatbot interface that there is an option to see the history and the history should be saved so I need that mechanism at the back end also.

4. Saved. There should be an option in the menu and also after anyone generates any content from the tools he should see this option and it is called saved( at the menu) or save ( at the tool/chatbot interface) . He should be able to save the work or the content he generated and he should be able to create folders and files under these folders and he will also be able to create file without any folder and it is like a standard file manager or I should say not complex but yeah it's like a normal file manager. I also want a search engine there, which will help the user to search among the files and folders. There should be also filters in the search engine. In case he will use the filter to search only folders or to search only files across the whole file manager functionality ( Suppose someone searched for SS. And if he uses a filter to only see the files then he should see the file SS which is under a folder and he will also see any file which is close to his search keyword even if it is not under any folder. )  And user should be able to download a file or a folder separately. and if he wants to download all the files and folders then he will have an option in the dashboard called Export to CSV and if he downloads files separately as a file then he will have several options like PDF or PPT.
